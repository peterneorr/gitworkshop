Once you've selected all the files that changed added them to the staging area you are ready to commit.
The commit command is what creates a changeset in git's history.
	git commit
	git commit -m "Fixes bug 314"



You can review git's history with the log of commits with the log command.
	git log
	git log --graph
	git log --oneline


Every changeset in git is assigned a SHA-1 hash.  
You can review the changes from any particular change by specifing this hash.  Usually git can figure out what you mean with just the first few characters of a hash:
	git show <hash>
