Because branching is so common in git, merges are done frequently.
	git merge <source branch>

The destination is always your current branch.  

Merging all the progress from the "foo" feature branch back into main "develop" branch might look like this:


Switch to develop branch:
	git checkout develop

Merge foo branch into develop
	git merge feature/foo

Most of the time, git will automatically resolve any merge conflicts and commit a new changeset that is the result of the merge.
When git cannot resolve conflicts, you will have to use a merge tool and commit.
