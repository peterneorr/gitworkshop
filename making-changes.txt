Git tracks files in your working directory.

The working directory is where you cloned (or created) the git repository.  

Make your edits with tools of your choice:  Visual Studio, Notepad++, vi, etc...

To see a list of files that have change since your last commit: 
	git status

Add your changes to the _staging area_.     
	git add <file> 

Note:  You can stage every file that has changed with the special "dot" syntax:
	git add .

Git rm does the opposite.  It removes a file from the staging area.


Note:  Visual studio uses the words "include" and "exclude".  What is really happening is "git add" and "git rm"
