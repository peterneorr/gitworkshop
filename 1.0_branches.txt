Your workspace can be "on" a single branch at any given time.  
The state of your workspace folder reflects the contents of this branch.  

See which branches exist with:
	git branch -l

You should see at least 1 branch called "master". Every repo is created with at least 1 branch called master.

Switch to another branch with:
	git checkout <branch name>

create a new branch and switch to it with :
	git checkout -b <branch name>
