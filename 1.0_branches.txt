Your workspace can be "on" a single branch at any given time.  
The state of your workspace folder reflects the contents of this branch.  

See which branches exist with:
	git branch -l

You should see at least 1 branch called "master". Every repo is created with at least 1 branch called master.

Switch to another branch with:
	git checkout <branch name>

create a new branch and switch to it with :
	git checkout -b <branch name>

Branches are useful for concurrent development of independent features.
Branch names can have a path-like names to help with organization.

"git-flow" is a popular way to work with git that prescribes branch naming conventions.  For example:

	master/
	develop/
	feature/dbRefactor
	feature/user-themes
	feature/richTextEditors
	release/v1.0
	release/v1.2
	release/v1.3
	hotfix/v1.3.1
